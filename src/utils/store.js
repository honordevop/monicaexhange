    title: "ANTI-MONEY LAUNDERING POLICY",
    desc: "Money laundering is a significant illicit activity that confronts the global financial system, presenting an escalating peril to nations and economies worldwide. This is predominantly due to the absence of a distinct form or manner, which enables it to evade detection for an extended duration. While technology has undeniably improved the efficacy of financial transactions worldwide, it has also contributed to the near-obscurity of this criminal activity and its offenders in the eyes of the law.     Further, define money laundering. The process of deceitfully handling, obfuscating, or shirking substantial quantities of illicit funds throughout legitimate financial establishments or enterprises. These funds are often referred to as 'unknown origins' or 'dirty money' due to the fact that they consist of gains or profits obtained through criminal activities such as human trafficking, drug trafficking, prostitution rings, weapons smuggling, or emblezzlement caused by corruption in political or corporate institutions. Moreover, they are typically received in substantial amounts, which may trigger 'alarms' or suspicions if transacted openly in legitimate financial institutions. Thus, in order to evade detection, money launderers distribute such sums across continents, countries, legitimate businesses, or phantom corporations. Similar developments are occurring in the digital realm regarding digital financial assets and tenders. \n Monica Xchng Global hereby affirms its resolute dedication to bolster and endorse endeavours aimed at combating money laundering. This is achieved through strict adherence to all Anti-Money Laundering (AML) policies and legislation in Nigeria, assuming full responsibility and playing a role against this worldwide illicit activity by incorporating all relevant and current regulations from the Financial Industry Regulatory Authority (FINRA), the Bank Secrecy Act (BSA), AML, and Combating Financing of Terrorism (CFT) into our operations. We are committed to maintaining rigorous oversight of all transactions occurring on the Monica Xchng Global platform in order to identify any suspicious activities and implement suitable measures to restrict the access and usage of our products by individuals engaged in fraudulent or unlawful endeavours. The risk-based approach is utilised by Monica Xchng Global when implementing Know Your Customer (KYC) procedures. This entails performing a Customer Due Diligence (CDD) on both transactions and users of our products. In addition to providing specific personal information during the account creation process on the Monica Xchng Global platform, customers may be obligated to furnish One-Time Passwords (OTPs), tokens, or PINs during the withdrawal process, contingent upon the parameters and magnitude of their deposit and withdrawal limits. \n By meticulously identifying, filing, and submitting accurate reports in accordance with the Securities and Exchange Commission's (SEC) Anti-Money Laundering and Combating Financing of Terrorism rules and regulations, Monica Xchng Global will consistently adhere to these regulations.",
